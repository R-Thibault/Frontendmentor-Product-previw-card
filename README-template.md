## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

First of all, I'm french and apologies for my english.

I learned a lot about positioning and how mobile first design save a lot of time. 

I restarted the project three time from scratch : 
- First try, I tried to set up everything with grid layout and a desktop first view.
- Second try,  I use flex, and was a lot easier but as I keep starting with desktop first, the responsive was hard to do.
- And then finaly, restart and strat by setting up mobile first, and with a media querrie deal with the desktop layout.

### Continued development

I started coding 2 month ago ( July 2022), so I'll just keep doing challenges to pratcice everything.

### Useful resources

- Kevin Powell's Youtube channel help me a lot, especially with flexbox/grid
